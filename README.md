🌱 About Me: An Explorer at Heart

Hello! I'm a passionate explorer navigating the intersection of three fascinating worlds: the serenity of **Nature**, the endless possibilities of **Technology**, and the profound journey of **Self-discovery**.

My professional path is in Marketing Analytics, where I use data to understand human behavior. But my personal quest is much broader—I seek to understand the world around me and the universe within me. Whether I'm hiking through a forest, coding a new project, or meditating on the nature of consciousness, I'm driven by a deep sense of curiosity.
*   🏞️ **Naturalist:** Capturing the beauty of the wild through my camera lens.
*   💻 **Technologist:** Eagerly learning new tools and frameworks to build and create.
*   🧘 **Seeker:** Exploring the connection between Mind, Body, and Spirit (Thân - Tâm - Trí).

I believe the best innovations come from a holistic understanding of life. Let's connect and share our journeys!
